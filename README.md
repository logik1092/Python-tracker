## Usage

### Getting Started

1. Start the application by running `PythonVersionTrackerPro.exe`
2. Click "Select Folder" to choose the Python project directory you want to track
3. The application will scan all Python files in the directory and display their VERSION tag status
4. Files with VERSION tags will be shown with a green "Has TAG" status
5. Files without VERSION tags will be shown with a yellow "Missing TAG" status

### Configuring Settings

- **Scan Interval**: Set how often (in seconds) the application scans for changes
- **File Filters**: Specify file patterns to exclude from monitoring
- **Auto-fix**: Enable automatic fixing of missing VERSION tags
- **Backup Files**: Create backups before modifying files with new VERSION tags
- **System Tray**: Minimize to system tray instead of closing when clicking X
- **Auto-start Tracking**: Automatically start tracking when the application launches

### Working with Files

- **Double-click** on a file to open it in your default editor
- **Right-click** on a file for additional options:
  - Add/Update VERSION Tag
  - Remove VERSION Tag
  - Open File
  - Show File Location
  - Copy Path

### Version History

1. Switch to the "Version History" tab to view the history of version changes
2. Select a file to see all its recorded versions
3. Select a version to view, restore, or compare it with another version

## VERSION Tag Format

Python Version Tracker Pro follows a standard VERSION tag format:

```python
VERSION = "1.0.0"
```

The tag should be placed in a specific order to ensure compatibility:

1. AFTER any shebang (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/python3`)
2. AFTER any encoding declaration (e.g., `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-`)
3. AFTER any module-level docstring (triple quotes)
4. AFTER any `from __future__ import ...` statements
5. BEFORE the first main import statement or function/class definition

## Configuration File

The application settings are stored in the `version_tracker_config.ini` file included in the package. This file is automatically created and updated when you change settings within the application.

## Troubleshooting

- **Files not showing**: Check if they are excluded in the file filters
- **VERSION tags not detected**: Ensure they follow the standard format `VERSION = "X.Y.Z"`
- **Application won't start**: Verify that both the .exe and config file are present
- **Error opening files**: Verify file permissions and that they exist at the specified location
